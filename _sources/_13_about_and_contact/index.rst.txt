Aerostack2 aims to ease the use and development of autonomous aerial robotics. Its distributed architecture using ROS2 allows for 
users and researchers to create and improve solutions within a certain domain without modifying the rest of the system. Aerostack2 beeing platform agnostic facilitates simulation to real 
procedures, as it has been demonstrated in many experiments and industrial projects. 

It has been successfully used in many applications, from research works to industrial projects such as automated wind turbines inspections and solar fields inspections. 
We encourage people to use, modify and create new components to be used in Aerostack2 Framework to be able to build and grow an open community, so we can all share our work and collaborate together.

Our main collaborators, currently active in the Aerostack2 development are:
