What is Aerostack2
==================

Aerostack is a software framework that helps developers design and build the control architecture of aerial robotic systems, integrating multiple heterogeneous computational solutions (e.g., computer vision algorithms, motion controllers, self-localization and mapping methods, motion planning algorithms, etc.). 

Aerostack is useful for building autonomous aerial systems in complex and dynamic environments and it is also a useful research tool for aerial robotics to test new algorithms and architectures.

Aerostack was created to be available for communities of researchers and developers and it is currently an active open-source project with periodic software releases. 

Multipurpose software framework
###############################

Aerostack is versatile for building different system configurations with various degrees of autonomy:

- From teleoperation to autonomous flight. Aerostack can be used for teleoperation flights (with manual control) but it can also be used for building autonomous robot systems to perform aerial missions without operator assistance.

- Single robots or multi-robot systems. Aerostack can be used to fly a swarm of heterogeneous drones to perform multi-aerial-robot missions. It has been validated to operate with up to five drones simultaneously.

- Flexible for different applications. Aerostack can be used by system designers to develop their own systems in a wide range of applications. Aerostack provides languages and graphical tools to configure specific aerial missions.

- Hardware independent. Aerostack runs on conventional laptops and it has also run on onboard computers like mastermind or odroid XU3. Aerostack has been used in different aerial platforms, including, but not limited to: DJI platforms (Matrice 210, Matrice 100, Ryze Tello), Parrot platforms (Bebop 2, AR Drone 1.0 & 2.0), Pixhawk, Mikrokopter Oktokopter and Asctec Pelican.
