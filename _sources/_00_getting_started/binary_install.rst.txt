Binary Install
==============

Currently, we only support binary installation on ROS2 Humble. We are working on binary installation for other ROS2 distributions.
To install all aerostack2 packages, run the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo apt install ros-humble-aerostack2 ros-humble-as2-ign-gazebo-assets ros-humble-as2-platform-ign-gazebo


You can also install only the packages you need. The available packages can be checked at `ROS Index <https://index.ros.org/search/?term=aerostack2&section=pkgs>`__.
