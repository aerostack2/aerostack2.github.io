Welcome to Aerostack2's documentation!
======================================

Aerostack2 is a framework developed to fly aerial platforms build for ROS2 `Humble <https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/index.html>`_ and ROS2 `Galactic <https://docs.ros.org/en/galactic/index.html>`_.

Most important features:
- Natively developed on ROS2
- Complete modularity, allowing elements to be changed or interchanged without affecting the rest of the system
- Independence of the aerial platform.
- Project-oriented, allowing to install and use only the necessary packages for the application to be developed. 
- Swarming orientation.
