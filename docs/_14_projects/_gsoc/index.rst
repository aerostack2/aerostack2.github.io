Project #1: New RViz2 RQT Plugins for Aerostack2
================================================

This project aims to enhance the visualization and interaction capabilities of the **Aerostack2**
framework by developing new **RViz2** and **RQT** plugins.
These plugins will provide **real-time monitoring**, **debugging**, and **control functionalities**
tailored to aerial robotics applications.

The project will focus on improving current **custom visualization plugins**
(`Aerostack2 Visualization <https://github.com/aerostack2/aerostack2/tree/main/as2_user_interfaces/as2_visualization/as2_visualization>`_)
to visualize drone states, trajectories, sensor data, and mission execution.
Moreover, it will create new RQT RViz tools
(`Aerostack2 RViz Plugins <https://github.com/aerostack2/aerostack2/tree/main/as2_user_interfaces/as2_visualization/as2_rviz_plugins>`_)
for intuitive interaction, such as sending commands, adjusting parameters, and monitoring system diagnostics.
Both tools will support drone swarms, not just single drones.

Project #2: RQT Keyboard Teleoperation & Alphanumeric View
==========================================================

This project aims to improve and extend the user interface capabilities of the **Aerostack2**
aerial robotics framework. To achieve this, we plan to replace and extend existing tools
such as the **Keyboard Teleoperation** and the **Alphanumeric Viewer**, integrating the new
tools as RQT plugins.

The already implemented `Keyboard Teleoperation <https://github.com/aerostack2/aerostack2/tree/main/as2_user_interfaces/as2_keyboard_teleoperation>`_ 
uses the PySimpleGUI library and functions as a simple ground station to control drones with
both position and speed commands.
It also allows pausing, resuming, and canceling Aerostack2 behaviors.
The goal is to completely remake this tool using RQT, discarding its PySimpleGUI counterpart.

The other tool is the `Alphanumeric Viewer <https://github.com/aerostack2/aerostack2/tree/main/as2_user_interfaces/as2_alphanumeric_viewer>`_.
This tool currently prints information in ASCII format in the console.
We do not intend to discard this tool, as it remains useful for its simplicity and the 
ability to view information via terminal when using SSH to connect to a remote onboard computer.
Instead, the new tool to be developed should serve as a more visually appealing and user-friendly
addition to monitor the drone's state.

Project #3: Migration of current ROS 2 Nodes to Lifecycle Nodes in Aerostack2
=============================================================================

This project aims to migrate **Aerostack2** existing **ROS 2 nodes** to **lifecycle nodes**.
`Lifecycle nodes <https://github.com/ros2/demos/blob/humble/lifecycle/README.rst>`__
provide a structured way to manage the state of a node, allowing better control over
initialization, execution, and shutdown processes. 

The work will involve refac`oring the current nodes to adopt the managed lifecycle model, implementing
state transitions to optimize resource usage, and ensuring seamless integration with existing aerostack2
components.
Additionally, performance evaluations will be conducted to validate the benefits of this migration.

.. _gsoc_project_4:

Project #4: Tool for visualizing ROS Nodes output log
=====================================================

The main objective of this project is to develop a tool to improve the debugging of stdout and stderr
outputs on ROS 2 systems with multiple nodes that produce console outputs, especially though the
recording and postprocessing of the rosbag files. 

Console outputs are produced using the `ROS 2 logging utilities <https://docs.ros.org/en/jazzy/Tutorials/Demos/Logging-and-logger-configuration.html>`__,
and are ultimately published through the /rosout topic. When rosbags are reproduced, console logs for 
all the nodes in the system are displayed in the same topic, which makes debugging hard in systems with 
multiple ROS 2 nodes. The work will involve the development of a tool that eases this task by providing 
a clear visualization of the console outputs for the different ROS 2 nodes. 

- **Skills Required/Preferred**
   ROS 2, C++, Python, QT

- **Difficulty Level**
   Medium

- **Expected Outcome**
   To be defined

- **Expected Size of the Project**

.. _gsoc_project_5:

Project #5: System Integration Tests and Continuous Integration
===============================================================

This project focuses on the implementation of Integration Test to the CI pipeline.
An Aerostack2-based system is expected to run drone missions that produce expected outputs.
Integration tests allow to check the different Aerostack2 modules keep working together before
contributions are made. 

Aerostack2 uses `Github Workflows <https://docs.github.com/en/actions/writing-workflows>`__ to make sure
Aerostack2 builds and passes all tests when a Pull Request to the project is opened.
`ROS 2 launch_testing package <https://docs.ros.org/en/iron/p/launch_testing/>`__ can be used to add tasks
to the Continuous Integration workflow and verify the functionalities of an Aerostack2 system as a 
whole.

- **Skills Required/Preferred**
   ROS 2, C++, Python, Github Workflows, Testing libraries

- **Difficulty Level**
   Medium

- **Expected Outcome**
   Extension of the Aerostack2 CI pipeline to include system testing

- **Expected Size of the Project**
   Medium (175h)

.. _gsoc_project_6:

Project #6: Development of a Project Creation Tool for Aerostack2
=================================================================

This project aims to develop a tool that simplifies the creation and management of projects in Aerostack2.
In Aerostack2, a "project" consists of a structured set of configurations, launch files, and assets
designed to address a specific problem or application.
The tool will provide an intuitive interface to generate and organize these elements, reducing setup time
and improving usability for developers and researchers.
It will include functionalities for defining project parameters, selecting relevant modules, and
automatically generating necessary files developing new script utils like get_drones.py.
By streamlining the process of configuring Aerostack2 for different applications, this tool will enhance
productivity and make the framework more accessible to a broader range of users.

.. _gsoc_project_7:

Project #7: Migration to ROS 2 Jazzy and Gazebo Harmonic
========================================================

This project aims to release an ROS 2 Jazzy compatible version of Aerostack2 framework. 

Jazzy is the latest Long-Term Support (LTS) distribution of the ROS 2 framework.
In this distribution, some fundamental issues have been resolved, making it convenient to migrate the
framework and make it available to the community. Furthermore, the primary simulator used in Aerostack2
is Gazebo, with the Harmonic version being the recommended choice for ROS 2 Jazzy.
Therefore, migrating the Gazebo-related components is also required. 

The work will involve resolving incompatibilities that arise from the version switch, validating the
correct functioning of the framework’s core functions, and adapting the Continuous Integration pipelines
and Docker containers. 

- **Skills Required/Preferred**
   ROS 2, C++, Python, Gazebo, Github Workflows

- **Difficulty Level**
   Easy

- **Expected Outcome**
   ROS 2 Jazzy compatible Aerostack2 package released in ROS distro repositories

.. _gsoc_project_8:

Project #8: Behavior Client Implementation for C++
==================================================

This project seeks to implement a Behavior Client that allows users to design missions using C++. 

Aerostack2 uses `behavior-based logic <https://aerostack2.github.io/_01_aerostack2_concepts/behaviors/index.html>`__
for mission definition and control. Currently, Aerostack2 has a 
`Python API <https://github.com/aerostack2/aerostack2/tree/main/as2_python_api>`__ with modules that
wrap around the different behaviors and implements functions that can be used in a Python script to make
calls to behaviors like a simple *go_to* or a *path_follower*.
A similar Behavior Client allows easier and faster mission definition using C++.

How to increase your chances of being selected in GSoC-2025
===========================================================

If you put yourself in the shoes of the mentor that should select the student, you’ll immediately realize that there are some behaviors that are usually rewarded. Here’s some examples.

1. **Be proactive**: Mentors are more likely to select students that openly discuss the existing ideas and / or propose their own. It is a bad idea to just submit your idea only in the Google web site without discussing it, because it won’t be noticed.
2. **Demonstrate your skills**: Consider that mentors are being contacted by several students that apply for the same project. A way to show that you are the best candidate, is to demonstrate that you are familiar with the software and you can code. How? Browse the bug tracker (issues in github of Aerostack2), fix some bugs and propose your patch submitting your PullRequest, and/or ask mentors to challenge you! Moreover, bug fixes are a great way to get familiar with the code.
3. **Demonstrate your intention to stay**: Students that are likely to disappear after GSoC are less likely to be selected. This is because there is no point in developing something that won’t be maintained. And moreover, one scope of GSoC is to bring new developers to the community.
