Google Summer of Code (GSoC)
============================

.. `Google Summer of Code <https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/>`__ is a global, online program focused on bringing new contributors into open source software development. GSoC Contributors work with an open source organization on a 12+ week programming project under the guidance of mentors.

`The Google Summer of Code (GSoC) <https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/>`__, is an international annual program, first held from May to August 2005, in which Google awards stipends, which depends on the purchasing power parity of the country the studentâ€™s university belongs to, to all students who successfully complete a requested free and open-source software coding project during the summer. The program is open to university students aged 18 or over. (source `Wikipedia <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Summer_of_Code>`__).


During Google Summer of Code, participating contributors are paired with mentors from open source organizations, gaining exposure to real-world software development techniques. Contributors will learn from experienced open source developers while writing code for real-world projects! A small stipend is provided as an incentive.
